== Introduction

A GeoPackage <<geopackage>> is a platform-independent SQLite <<sqlite>> database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables.
GeoPackage is designed to be extensible, including support for additional data types.
Six GeoPackage extensions were developed as part of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot project. 
In this repository, each is presented using the http://www.geopackage.org/spec120/#extension_template[GeoPackage Extension Template].
